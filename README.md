## Hi everyone 👋

I am Tanishq – An engineering turned entrepreneur. For 8 years I have lead [Scarlet](https://bescarlet.com), a conceptualisation studio, and have helped people start their brands, deploy their products and perform well in the market through product development, brand strategy and advertising.

I have founded **some** successful ([Whoosh](https://wearwhoosh.com), [TheLabs](https://thelabs.in)) and **many** failed brands _(Codecostume, Private Cubicles, Logodeer.. etc)_ and products over the last few years as I experimented with various aspects of life. Currently ⏱ I am working with a couple of in-house brands to launch cool products in the market and consulting companies with respect to their product development strategy.

– 👨‍💻 I usually code with JavaScript (MERN) with increasing focus on JAM Stack.
– 🕺 You can consider me just-passable as a designer.
– 🧠 I can be handy with brand strategy, psychological understanding of consumers and brand positioning.
