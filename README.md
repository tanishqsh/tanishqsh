## Hi everyone 👋

I am Tanishq – An engineer entrepreneur. For 8 years I have lead [Scarlet](https://bescarlet.com), a conceptualisation studio, and have helped people start their brands, deploy their products and perform well in the market through product development, brand strategy and advertising.

I have founded **some** successful ([Whoosh](https://wearwhoosh.com), [TheLabs](https://thelabs.in)) and **many** failed brands _(Codecostume, Private Cubicles, Logodeer.. etc)_ and products over the last few years as I experimented with various aspects of life. Currently ⏱ I am working as a product designer with Dropmints!

👨‍💻 I usually code with JavaScript (MERN) with increasing focus on JAM Stack.  
🕺 You can probably [consider me just passable as a designer 🤭](https://www.behance.net/tanishqsh).  
🧠 I can be handy with brand strategy, psychological understanding of consumers and brand positioning.
